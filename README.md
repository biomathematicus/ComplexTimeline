# ComplexTimeline
LaTeX code to create complex timelines

Capturing a complex professional trajectory in a single timeline can be quite difficult because a person’s career is often characterized by a diverse set of experiences and accomplishments that cannot be easily summarized or condensed into a simple linear format.

Intersecting bubbles offer an interesting solution to complex timelines. They can be built manually with a tool such as PowerPoint, or programmatically with LaTeX or some other programming language.

A professional timeline with activity bubbles solves several problems. A person may have worked in several different industries or roles over the course of their career, which can make it difficult to convey the full breadth of their experiences in a simplified timeline. Additionally, a person may have held multiple positions at the same organization, or taken time off for personal reasons, which can also make it challenging to fit all of the relevant information into a single timeline.

Another difficulty is that professional achievements and contributions often do not follow a simple linear progression, but rather may be cumulative and intersecting in nature. Some tasks can be parallel and complex and some achievements can be incremental and hard to track and highlight in a linear timeline.

Moreover, a person’s professional trajectory may also be influenced by factors such as mentorship and networking, which are difficult to capture in a linear format. Finally, the format of a single timeline can be a limiting factor, since it can’t capture the complexity of some individuals who have achieved success or mastery in multiple or parallel fields.
