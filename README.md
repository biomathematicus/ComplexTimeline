LaTeX code to create complex timelines

Professional achievements and contributions often do not follow a simple linear progression, but rather may be cumulative and intersecting in nature. Some tasks can be parallel and complex and some achievements can be incremental and hard to track and highlight in a linear timeline.

Intersecting bubbles offer an interesting solution to complex timelines. They can be built manually with a tool such as PowerPoint, or programmatically with LaTeX or some other programming language.
